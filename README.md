# sample_code

In the "Machine learning sample code.ipynb", I used cross validation and various machine learning model to build a composite model that predicts a venue's popularity. The dataset of venue popularities is provided by Yelp. I've omitted the dataset's url.

In the "Spark (Scala) sample code.ipynb", I used StackOverflow data to analyze the stats of veteran users vs. brief users. If a user has made a post within a time window between 100 and 150 days after account creation, I consider the user "veteran". A full schema of the dataset can be found [here](https://ia801500.us.archive.org/8/items/stackexchange/readme.txt) which originates from [this](https://archive.org/details/stackexchange).

The datasets themselves are not included in this folder.
